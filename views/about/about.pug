            | Hello, I am James Studd, currently a student about to complete my final year of Teesside University. I really enjoy working with any sort of language/framework that I can, ranging anywhere from 
            a(href='/search?query=Unity&blog=on&project=on') Unity
            |  to 
            a(href='/search?query=Node&blog=on&project=on') Node
            |  to 
            a(href='/search?query=Python&blog=on&project=on') Python
            |  to 
            a(href='/search?query=Arduino&blog=on&project=on') Arduino,
            |  as well as currently trying to learn more C++.
            | I have been programming since I started university (5 years ago) and I've loved making anything and everything whilst doing it. My goto has always been games, whether that's a text based game 1 week into programming, a 48 hour game jam rush:

            |  and 
            a(href='http://www.jamesstudd.com/PacketPass/') Packet Pass as part of Global Game Jam.
            |  or a tiny

            | When the time came to apply to a company for my placement year, I decided to create a blog/portfolio to aid in that process. I eventually settled on using Jekyll, a static site generator that seems very popular for blogging, as well as using Github pages for hosting. Jekyll makes blogging exceptionally easy, writing a post in markdown and then running a command to convert it to HTML. After a year (or so) of using Jekyll, I decided to just create my own blogging system using my favourite web dev framework - Node. Granted whoever views the website might not see much difference, but I believe I now have much better control over what my website does/looks like. This website (at the moment) uses Express, Pug and Mongoose, as well as a few other smaller libraries. For a full blog post of the development process,
